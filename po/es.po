"Plume instances form one part of a huge network, collectively called the "

"able to communicate with microblogging apps like <a href=\"https://"
"joinmastodon.org\">Mastodon</a>, or <a href=\"https://pleroma.social/"
"\">Pleroma</a>. Even other blogging apps which support federation, such as "
"<a href=\"https://writefreely.org\">WriteFreely</a> can also communicate "
